I am a Computer Science graduate. I have a zeal for learning, experimenting and adopting new thoughts.

My fascination for Data Science is a natural extension from my interesting endeavors into IT consulting with Indiaâ€™s top technology firm - Tata Consultancy Services. My various 
project stints through my 10 year long professional career have given me sufficient opportunities to sharpen my analytical and logical skills. It honed my programming and 
analytical abilities and gave me an opportunity to translate real life problems into easy computable solutions. 

The highlight of my work experience that inspired me to pursue a Data Science career was working on developing organisational strategy by metric reporting and dashboarding with 
the Learning and Development Team. 

This aspect has fueled my passion to delve deep in this field. I have been seeking online materials to learn more about the subject. I have also done small and big projects to get
a hands on experience about the subject. 

I feel very excited about the possibility of collaborating with like minded people here to learn and experiment.
